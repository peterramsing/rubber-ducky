# Rubber Ducky

This project was spurred off of the desire to create an open source project and to also help msyelf and other developers solve problems.

This project currently is very much a WIP. Feel free to create new issues for features or chime in on current issues with any input.

This project currently has only one milestone currently:
[see milestone](https://github.com/peterramsing/rubber-ducky/milestones/)

A user should be able to:
- Select at least 1 category
- Be given at least 6 different problem solving questions

This will grow and adapt...or I'll get really busy and this will not go anywhere too far.


#### My personal goals from this project
- Build an Angular app
- Write better tested code
- Learn what questions I can be asking myself in my day job to solve problems faster and better
- Contribute to the open source community, without which I would not be who I am today




This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
